Activity 4
================
Cleyde Murillo, Jr.

## Data and packages

Most of the functions that we will use this semester are from the
`{tidyverse}` (which is a package of many packages - a super package).
While we will focus on `{dplyr}`, it will be nice to be able to produce
graphical displays. Therefore, instead of loading both `{dplyr}` and
`{ggplot2}`, in the code chunk below we load all of the `{tidyverse}`.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

There is some other useful items to point out from this code chunk:

1.  It has been named (i.e., `load_packages`). Notice that the name
    doesn’t contain any spaces (I used `_` to separate words). If you
    put spaces in your R code chunk names, you might encounter errors
    later when you Knit your document. This is helpful because if you
    create a plot within a code chunk, the image will have that name!
    Another helpful thing by naming code chunks is that it helps with
    document navigation. In the upper right-hand corner of this `.Rmd`
    file, you can see the document outline
    <img src="README-img/document-outline-icon.png" alt="document outline" width = "20"/>
    icon. Clicking on this provides you with a table of contents type
    view. Another way to see this information by clicking on the “\#
    Data and packages” at the bottom left-hand area of this `.Rmd` pane.
2.  There is a code chunk option of `message = FALSE`…

### Messages

Knit your report with the `message = FALSE` R code chunk option and pay
attention to how this particular code chunk and output for loading the
`{tidyverse}` looks.

Now, switch this option to `message = TRUE` and knit your report again.
Discuss what is different when the `message` option is turned on
(`TRUE`) and turned off (`FALSE`) for the previous code chunk.

**Any additional console messages besides the output will show if
‘message = TRUE’, and will not show if ‘message = FALSE’.**:

Turn the `message` option off and continue in this activity.

### Data

In this activity, we will explore data on college majors and earnings
from the data behind the FiveThirtyEight story [The Economic Guide To
Picking A College
Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).
These data originally come from the American Community Survey (ACS)
2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. If you are curious about how the
raw data from the ACS were cleaned and prepared (not a requirement), see
the FiveThirtyEight author’s
[code](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/college-majors-rscript.R).

As we progress through this activity, remember that there are many
considerations that go into picking a major. Earning potential and
employment prospects are two (important) of these considerations, but
they do not tell the entire story. Keep this in mind as we analyze the
data.

These data are from an external (to R) file - a comma separated values
(`.csv`) file. We will use the `readr::read_csv` function to read in
these data. When you see something in this form, I am referring to the
function as well as what package it is from (i.e., `package::function`).
We will talk more about `::` later in the course.

I try to be consistent with notation so here are some other forms that
you might see in documents:

-   “`{package_name}`”; for example, `{readr}`.
-   “`function_name` function”; for example, `read_csv` function.
-   “*hint*”; for example, *arrange* the variable.
-   “**Specific Area**”; for example, **Environment** tab.

``` r
# Note that the :: method is redundant here
# because we have already loaded the {tidyverse}
# and {readr} is included in this.
# However, I am using this method to make you
# aware of the specific package the read_csv
# function comes from.

college_recent_grads <- readr::read_csv("data/recent-grads.csv")
```

Notice that this dataset is in a folder called `data`. We read it in
with the `read_csv` function, then saved the results as a new data frame
called `college_recent_grads`. You can view the entire dataset by
clicking on the name of the data frame in the **Environment** tab (make
sure you have run both the `load_packages` and `load_data` code chunks).

Explore and describe what the `message` option does in `load_data` code
chunk.

**Any additional console messages will not be shown**:

Turn the `message` option off and continue in this activity.

#### Aside

Base R has a function for reading in a csv file as well. Type the
following in your **Console** pane, pressing Enter/Return at the end:

    temp <- read.csv("data/recent-grads.csv")

Pause and look at the lack of output/messaging.

Now type the following in your **Console** pane, pressing Enter/Return
at the end:

    temp

Pause and look at the output. You will probably need to scroll up a bit
to see the beginning of it.

Now type the following in your **Console** pane, pressing Enter/Return
at the end:

    college_recent_grads

Pause and look at the output. Compare this to your `temp` output.

If you were to load the data using `read.csv` in an `.Rmd` file and try
to view it, it will print the ENTIRE dataset - this could make a short
report many hundreds of pages depending on the size of your dataset.
Historically, there were some other benefits of `readr::read_csv` over
`read.csv`, but these have mostly been updated to no longer be issues. I
encourage you to use `readr::read_csv` instead of `read.csv`.

## Quick Data View

Below is a blank R code chunk. Name this code chunk `college_grads_top`;
you do not need to suppress messages. In this code chunk, type
`college_recent_grads` to view the top few (first 10) entries of the
dataset.

``` r
head(college_recent_grads)
```

We can see that this data frame has a lot of useful information. In the
remaining sections we will answer the following questions:

-   Which major has the lowest unemployment rate? Mathematics/Computer
    Science
-   Which major has the highest percentage of women? Early Childhood
    Education
-   Which STEM majors have incomes less than the median income of all
    majors?

Note that the ACS only asks [one
question](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/about/why-we-ask-each-question/sex/)
about a person’s sexual identity and we are therefore missing a lot of
important details about individuals.

## Analysis

### Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?

Nuclear Engineering \#\#\#\# Describe your process I used the arrange
function to show the observations with the lowest unemployment rate.

What information (variables) do we need to answer this question?
Describe how you would go about answering this question using a
different software (e.g., Excel, SAS, Python) that you are familiar with
or simply a general process. You do not need to code anything. As you
write this process, think of it as a series of steps and it might be
helpful to start at the goal and work backwards.

**Since we have the unemployment rate variable we arranged the dataset
from its lowest to highest and recorded the observation with the lowest
that way**:

#### Using `{dplyr}`

In the R code chunk below, name it `rearrange_college`.

Take the `college_recent_grads` dataset, *then* `arrange` the dataset by
`unemployment_rate`.

``` r
arrange(college_recent_grads, desc(unemployment_rate))
```

    ## # … with 163 more rows, and 13 more variables: sharewomen <dbl>,
    ## #   employed <dbl>, employed_fulltime <dbl>, employed_parttime <dbl>,
    ## #   employed_fulltime_yearround <dbl>, unemployed <dbl>,
    ## #   unemployment_rate <dbl>, p25th <dbl>, median <dbl>, p75th <dbl>,
    ## #   college_jobs <dbl>, non_college_jobs <dbl>, low_wage_jobs <dbl>

We have all of the information to answer our question (i.e., “Which
major has the lowest unemployment rate?”), but it is not in an effective
format. The major names barely fit on the page, we have many variables
are not that useful in answering our question (e.g., `major_code`,
`major_category`), and some variables that we might want
front-and-center are not easily viewed (i.e., `unemployment_rate`).
Also, notice that by default when you *arrange* by a variable, it
defaults to *ascending* order.

#### Removing unnecessary information

Use the pipeline that you made in the `rearrange_college` code chunk as
the start to this solution, **then** `select` only the variables `rank`,
`major`, and `unemployment_rate`. Name this code chunk
`lowest_unemploy`.

``` r
arrange(college_recent_grads, desc(unemployment_rate)) %>% select(major, unemployment_rate)
```

    ## # A tibble: 173 x 2
    ##    major                                      unemployment_rate
    ##    <chr>                                                  <dbl>
    ##  1 Nuclear Engineering                                    0.177
    ##  2 Public Administration                                  0.159
    ##  3 Computer Networking And Telecommunications             0.152
    ##  4 Clinical Psychology                                    0.149
    ##  5 Public Policy                                          0.128
    ##  6 Communication Technologies                             0.120
    ##  7 Mining And Mineral Engineering                         0.117
    ##  8 Computer Programming And Data Processing               0.114
    ##  9 Geography                                              0.113
    ## 10 Architecture                                           0.113
    ## # … with 163 more rows

**We leveraged the arrange function and then used the select function to
limit which variables to view in our output**:

### Which major has the highest proportion of women?

Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`,
`arrange` the dataset by `sharewomen`, and `select` only `rank`,
`major`, and `sharewomen`. Name your code chunk `highest_prop_women`.

``` r
arrange(college_recent_grads, desc(sharewomen)) %>% select(rank, major, sharewomen)
```

    ## # A tibble: 173 x 3
    ##     rank major                                         sharewomen
    ##    <dbl> <chr>                                              <dbl>
    ##  1   165 Early Childhood Education                          0.969
    ##  2   164 Communication Disorders Sciences And Services      0.968
    ##  3    52 Medical Assisting Services                         0.928
    ##  4   139 Elementary Education                               0.924
    ##  5   151 Family And Consumer Sciences                       0.911
    ##  6   101 Special Needs Education                            0.907
    ##  7   157 Human Services And Community Organization          0.906
    ##  8   152 Social Work                                        0.904
    ##  9    35 Nursing                                            0.896
    ## 10    89 Miscellaneous Health Medical Professions           0.881

Discuss your output as it relates to the research question.

**The major with the largest proportion of women is ‘Early Childhood
Education’ followed by ‘Communication Disorders Sciences and
Services’**:

questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Which STEM majors have incomes less than the median income of all majors?

One of the sections of the FiveThirtyEight story is “All STEM fields
aren’t the same”. We will see if this is true.

Below is a new vector called `stem_categories` that lists the *major
categories* (this is not the `majors` variable - look back at the Data
Codebook) that are considered STEM fields.

``` r
stem_categories <- c("Biology & Life Science",
                     "Computers & Mathematics",
                     "Engineering",
                     "Physical Sciences")
```

In our next activity we will see how to calculate summary statistics,
but for now believe me that the median salary for all majors is $36,000.

Using the `stem_categories` vector and knowledge that the median salary
for all majors is $36,000 to *keep* the rows in the
`college_recent_grads` data set that are in the STEM fields and earn
*less* than the `median` salary of all majors. Only display the
variables `major`, `p25th`, `median`, and `p75th` Name the code chunk
`stem_low_salaries`.

``` r
college_recent_grads %>% filter(major_category %in% stem_categories)  %>% arrange(median) %>% select(major, p25th, median, p75th)
```

    ## # A tibble: 64 x 4
    ##    major                                 p25th median p75th
    ##    <chr>                                 <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>
    ##  1 Zoology                               20000  26000 39000

    ##  3 Biology                               24000  33400 45000
    ##  4 Miscellaneous Biology                 23000  33500 48000
    ##  5 Multi-Disciplinary Or General Science 24000  35000 50000
    ##  6 Physiology                            20000  35000 50000
    ##  7 Communication Technologies            25000  35000 45000
    ##  8 Neuroscience                          30000  35000 44000
    ##  9 Atmospheric Sciences And Meteorology  28000  35000 50000
    ## 10 Environmental Science                 25000  35600 40200
    ## # … with 54 more rows

Discuss your output as it relates to the research question.
